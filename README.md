## 📌 What It Is

Codex is a basic online code editor that allows you to write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and see the results instantly in your browser.  
It is designed for beginners who want to practice front-end development without needing any complex setup.

This project does **not** include built-in helper features, so users write code on their own and directly observe the output — encouraging learning by doing.
